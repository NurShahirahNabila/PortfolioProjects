📊 Consumer Demographics and Bike Purchases - Interactive Excel Dashboard

📌 Project Overview  
This project is an interactive Excel dashboard analyzing consumer demographics and purchasing behavior, particularly focusing on whether individuals have purchased a bike.
The dataset includes various factors such as income, education, occupation, marital status, commute distance, and car ownership to uncover trends in consumer decisions.
